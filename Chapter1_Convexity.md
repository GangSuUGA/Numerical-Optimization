## Chapter1_Convexity

# Why is conveity important? 

For convex programming problems, and more particularly for linear programs, local solutions are also global solutions, which generally makes them easier to solve both in theory and practice. 

On the other hand, general nonlinear problems, both constrained and unconstrained, may possess local solutions that are not global solutions.
