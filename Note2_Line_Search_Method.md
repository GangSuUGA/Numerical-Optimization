## Bisection Method
In bisection method we reduce begin with an interval so that 0 âˆˆ [a, b] and divide the interval in two
halves,i.e. [a, (a+b)/2] and [(a+b)/2 , b]. A next search interval is chosen by comparing and finding which one
has zero. This is done by evaluating the sign. The algorithm for this is given as follows: Choose a, b
so that f(a)f(b) < 0
