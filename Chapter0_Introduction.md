Optimization is an important tool in decision science and in the analysis of physical systems. Optimization model attempts to express, in mathematical terms, the goal of solving a problem in the "best" way. 

To make use of this tool, we must first identify some objective, a quantitative measure of the performance of the system under study. 

The objective depends on certain characteristics of the system, called variables or unknowns. Our goal is to find values of the variables that optimize the objective. 

The process of identifying objective, variables, and constraints for a given problem is known as modeling. Construction of an appropriate model is the first step—sometimes the most important step—in the optimization process.

Once the model has been formulated, an optimization algorithm can be used to find its solution, usually with the help of a computer.

After an optimization algorithm has been applied to the model, we must be able to recognize whether it has succeeded in its task of finding a solution. 
In many cases, there are elegant mathematical expressions known as optimality conditions for checking that the current set of variables is indeed the solution of the problem. If the optimality conditions are not satisfied, they may give useful information on how the current estimate of the solution can be improved. The model may be improved by applying techniques such as sensitivity analysis, which reveals the sensitivity of the solution to changes in the model and data.

Interpretation of the solution in terms of the applicationmay also suggest ways in which the model can be refined or improved (or corrected). If any changes are made to the model, the optimization problem is solved anew, and the process repeats.
