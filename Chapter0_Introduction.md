# Numerical-Optimization
Optimization is an important tool in decision science and in the analysis of physical systems. 

Tomake use of this tool,wemust first identify some objective, a quantitativemeasure of the performance of the systemunder study. 

The objective depends on certain characteristics of the system, called variables or unknowns. 

Our goal is to find values of the variables that optimize the objective. 

The process of identifying objective, variables, and constraints for a given problem is known as modeling. 

Construction of an appropriate model is the first step—sometimes the most important step—in the optimization process.
